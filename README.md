# Growing-with-Data-Analytics

## Get to Know Me 

Hello! My name is Hermonise. Growing up I wanted to make a difference in the world. I loved interacting with and learning about people, how they work, feel and what makes them who they are. This passion for connection lead me to the healthcare field specifically psychology and mental health. I wanted to understand how people viewed themselves and their interaction with others in the hopes that I would learn something about myself and how I relate to the world. I have learned that accessibility is a blocker for growth. I want to make data accessible. I want to make change accessible so people can grow in ways they couldn't imagine before.

From case management to project management to me means bridging the gap between the internal and the external. Using my experience to bring new life to data using a people-first approach. I have spent my time learning more about project management, data analytics and business intelligence through certifications and have formulated a repository to highlight what I have learned. This repository is to showcase and track my own growth as a data analyst. I want to continue to look at where I started and where I am currently at any given time in a meaningful way.
